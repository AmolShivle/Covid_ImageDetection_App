# COVID-19 Detection in Chest X-ray images using Deep Learning

# Problem Statement:

- As one of the most effective tools for identifying COVID-19, chest X-rays have played a crucial role in diagnosing and monitoring the progression of the disease. However, the manual interpretation of these images by healthcare professionals can be time-consuming and subjective, often leading to delays in diagnosis and potential errors.

- Unfortunately, healthcare systems in many parts of the world, including Myanmar, face resource constraints, limited access to specialized expertise, and a lack of sophisticated diagnostic tools. These challenges hinder the timely detection and appropriate management of respiratory diseases, leading to increased morbidity and mortality rates.

# Obective:

The goal is to leverage deep learning techniques to . . . 

- Develop an automated system capable of accurately detecting COVID-19.
- Facilitate early detection and treatment
- Improve Healthcare Outcomes
- Create an Accessible Health Care Solution
- Facilitate Knowledge Sharing and Education
