# COVID-19 Detection in Chest X-ray images using Deep Learning

## Problem Statement:

- As one of the most effective tools for identifying COVID-19, chest X-rays have played a crucial role in diagnosing and monitoring the progression of the disease. However, the manual interpretation of these images by healthcare professionals can be time-consuming and subjective, often leading to delays in diagnosis and potential errors.

- Unfortunately, healthcare systems in many parts of the world, including Myanmar, face resource constraints, limited access to specialized expertise, and a lack of sophisticated diagnostic tools. These challenges hinder the timely detection and appropriate management of respiratory diseases, leading to increased morbidity and mortality rates.

## Obective:
The goal is to leverage deep learning techniques to . . . 
- Develop an automated system capable of accurately detecting COVID-19.
- Facilitate early detection and treatment
- Improve Healthcare Outcomes

## Datasets
The datasets have multiple covid and non-covid images and divided into train and test subfolders.


## Usage
To run this project, open the notebook Omdena_Covid_Xception.ipynb in Google Colab and start executing each cell as instructed. The notebook contains detailed instructions about how to download the dataset from google drive your account.



## Evaluation

The following figure shows how training and validation accuracy change over epochs during the training process. It also represents the changes in training and validation loss over the training epochs.



## Conclusion

developed the streamlit app to predict the image for covid or non-covid.
